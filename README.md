## Introduction

Describe the purpose and goals of your project here. What problem does it solve, and what features does it offer? Briefly introduce your SQLAlchemy models and their relationships.

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to set up and run your project.

### Prerequisites

List any software or tools that need to be installed before running the application. For example:

- Python 3.8+
- SQLAlchemy
- Alembic (for migrations)

### Installation

Step-by-step instructions on how to install and configure your project. Include commands, if applicable.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the database and apply migrations:

sh
Copy code
alembic init migrations
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial"
alembic upgrade head
Usage
Explain how to use your application. Provide examples of how to interact with the system, run queries, and utilize its features.

Models
Describe your SQLAlchemy models in detail. Include their attributes, relationships, and any other relevant information. For example:

Restaurant
Attributes:

id (Integer): Primary key
name (String): Restaurant name
price (Integer): Price rating
Relationships:

reviews: One-to-many relationship with reviews
Customer
Attributes:

id (Integer): Primary key
first_name (String): First name
last_name (String): Last name
Relationships:

reviews: One-to-many relationship with reviews
Review
Attributes:

id (Integer): Primary key
star_rating (Integer): Rating (1-5 stars)
customer_id (Integer): Foreign key to Customer
restaurant_id (Integer): Foreign key to Restaurant
Relationships:

customer: Many-to-one relationship with Customer
restaurant: Many-to-one relationship with Restaurant
Methods
Explain the methods and functionalities provided by your models. Use subsections for each model and method. For example:

Restaurant
reviews(): Returns a collection of all the reviews for the Restaurant.
customers(): Returns a collection of all the customers who reviewed the Restaurant.
Customer
reviews(): Returns a collection of all the reviews that the Customer has left.
restaurants(): Returns a collection of all the restaurants that the Customer has reviewed.
Sample Code
Provide sample code snippets demonstrating how to use your methods. For example:

python
Copy code
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
from app.models import Restaurant, Customer, Review

# Create an SQLAlchemy engine
engine = create_engine('sqlite:///my_database.db')

# Create a session
Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
session = Session()

# Example usage:
restaurant = session.query(Restaurant).filter_by(name='My Restaurant').first()
reviews = restaurant.reviews()
for review in reviews:
    print(f"Rating: {review.star_rating}, Customer: {review.customer.full_name()}")
